            <p class="about">
                I became interested in software development when I met a friend from highschool
                who could write software that helped us with homework. After that interest came about
                I signed up for a highschool class being offered by an organization called operation
                spark. It taught us how to use HTML CSS and JavaScript. This is when I developed my 
                passion for programming. After I graduated from highschool I immediately knew what my
                major would be and it was computer science. I chose to minor in robotics so I could get
                into a more hands-on field if I choose to. My dream would be to work for a company that 
                is a house hold name and contributes to a better future.
